# K3S Cluster Management Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the structure and management practices of our Kubernetes (k3s) cluster, hosted on Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) using Linux Containers (LXC). The cluster consists of both controller and worker nodes managed through Ansible automation for tasks such as upgrades, configuration changes, and routine maintenance.

## Architecture

- **Proxmox VE (PVE)**: Hosts our LXC containers running k3s components.
- **K3s Cluster**: A lightweight Kubernetes cluster comprising:
  - **Controller Node(s)**: Runs the Kubernetes control plane.
  - **Worker Node(s)**: Hosts the deployed applications and services.

## Installation

K3s installation within LXC containers is managed through Ansible. The installation script is fetched directly from k3s.io and executed within each container, specifying the node role (controller or worker) and other configurations.

## Upgrading K3S

Upgrades are performed using the `k3s/playbook-upgrade-k3s.yaml` Ansible playbook. The process is designed to be idempotent and minimize disruption:

1.  **Target Version Determination:** The playbook automatically determines the latest stable K3s version by querying the `https://update.k3s.io/v1-release/channels/stable` endpoint.
2.  **Node Version Check:** It checks the currently installed K3s version on each node (`/usr/local/bin/k3s --version`).
3.  **Conditional Upgrade:** The upgrade steps are only performed if the node's current version does not match the target version.
4.  **Worker Node Upgrade Order:** Worker nodes are upgraded first, one by one.
    *   **Drain:** The worker node is drained using `kubectl drain` executed on the controller node via `pct exec`. The `--disable-eviction` flag is used to bypass PodDisruptionBudgets (Note: This was necessary for Vault pods and may cause temporary service disruption if PDBs are strictly required).
    *   **Upgrade:** The standard K3s upgrade script (`curl | sh`) is executed on the worker node via `pct exec`.
    *   **Uncordon:** The worker node is uncordoned using `kubectl uncordon` executed on the controller node via `pct exec`.
5.  **Controller Node Upgrade:** The controller node is upgraded last by executing the K3s upgrade script directly via `pct exec`. Draining is skipped for the single controller setup.

This ensures worker nodes are gracefully handled, and upgrades only occur when necessary.
